## About the Author

Hi, Tushar Sethi this side. I graduated this year after completing my Btech(MnC) and joined Quadeye Securities as a Quantitative Strategist. 

## Introduction
Quant research, often confused with HFT, is a broad domain covering many roles. It can be analysing financial data, proposing and implementing models, etc. Here in IITD, most quant roles involve a prerequisite of a good hold in programming; financial knowledge is a plus, but mostly learn with the work. 


## Tips to pursue Quant
I wonder about things I missed in my first year, and exploring this field is one of them. Learn how basic trading works, explore asset classes and their associated risk-reward tradeoffs and familiarise yourself with DSA (multi-field applications). It is optional for you to enter this field as a career option, but acquiring this much knowledge will help somehow.
