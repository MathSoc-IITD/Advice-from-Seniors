## About the Author

Hi, I'm Aadil Akhtar, a Mathematics and Computing 2024 graduate. I was a member of the stage team of Ankahi, the dramatics society of IIT Delhi and also part of ANCC(Algorithms & Coding Club) IITD. I interned at Atlassian as a Software Engineer intern in the Backup & Restore team during the summer after my third year. I received a PPO from there and will be joining as SDE 1.

## Introduction
SDE stands for software development engineer. It's a broad term which can be subdivided into various roles. Firstly, it can be related to web or app development(Android or iOS). Then you can be either frontend engineer, one who is responsible for building the user interface, Ui/Ux components, basically how the application will look to the user, backend engineer, one who is responsible for writing all the back logic of all the components shown in frontend and managing the database, devops engineer, who is responsible for integrating everything, cloud engineer, who is responsible for deploying and managing system on cloud, Linux engineer, who specialises in building and maintaining Linux based systems.

## Tips to pursue SDE
If you want to explore this field, you'll definitely need to learn coding, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc. DSA(Data Structures & Algorithms) and competitive programming will help you crack down on your interviews. You can explore and do self projects, a lot of such basic projects are available online, some have video tutorials on YouTube, others have their code public on GitHub. IIT Delhi has two clubs - ANCC(focusing on competitive programming) and DevClub(focusing on web and app development)- so check them out. You can try open-source contributions on GitHub and GSoC if you're motivated.
