## About the Author

My name is Vaibhav, and I am a final-year Mathematics and Computing undergraduate at IIT Delhi. I began my machine learning journey in the second semester of my first year, guided by a mentor who introduced me to the field and helped me get started with the basics. Over the years, I have completed several courses, projects, and even an internship in Machine Learning. My interests primarily lie in Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. Through this article, I aim to help you get started with AI/ML, much like my mentor did for me.
Additionally, I am one of the founding members of the Artificial Intelligence Society at IIT Delhi, which has been instrumental in fostering a community passionate about AI/ML.

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields in technology today. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, allowing them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. Machine Learning, a subset of AI, involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. These technologies are transforming industries and creating new opportunities for innovation and growth.

Imagine a world where your phone can understand your voice commands, cars drive themselves, and healthcare systems can predict diseases before they happen. This is not science fiction—this is the power of AI and ML. As a first-year student, diving into AI/ML means you get to be at the forefront of this technological revolution. You'll have the chance to work on projects that can make a real-world impact, from improving business operations to advancing scientific research. The skills you learn will be in high demand, opening doors to exciting career opportunities in various fields such as tech, finance, healthcare, and more.


## How a First-Year Student Can Explore and Pursue AI/ML
### 1. Online Courses and Tutorials:
- Coursera, edX, and Udacity: These platforms offer courses from top universities and companies. Look for introductory courses on AI and ML.
- Institute Courses: Refer to course webpages of COL774, ELL409, ELL884, COL772, COL775, etc., to learn about machine learning, deep learning, NLP, etc.
- CS229: A very good course by Andrew Ng to get a good grasp of essential machine learning concepts.
### 2. Books and Reading Material:
- "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig: A comprehensive introduction to AI.
- "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron: Great for practical learning and implementation.
### 3. Practical Experience:
- Projects: Start small with personal projects, like building a simple chatbot or analyzing a dataset. Platforms like GitHub are great for sharing your work and collaborating with others.
- Internships: Seek out internships or research opportunities in AI/ML. These can provide hands-on experience and mentorship from professionals in the field.
- Hackathons and Competitions: Participate in events like Kaggle competitions or university hackathons to apply your skills in real-world scenarios.
### 4. By Joining ARIES-IIT Delhi:
- Artificial Intelligence Society, IIT Delhi: This student-run AI/ML club hosts several training sessions, AI discussions, hackathons, projects, industrial collaborations, etc., which will help you gain exposure to the field of AI/ML.
Exploring AI/ML as a first-year student can be incredibly rewarding. With dedication and curiosity, you'll find countless resources and opportunities to grow your knowledge and skills in this dynamic field.
