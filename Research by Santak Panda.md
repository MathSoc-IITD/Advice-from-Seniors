## About the Author

My name is Vaibhav, and I am a final-year Mathematics and Computing undergraduate at IIT Delhi. I began my machine learning journey in the second semester of my first year, guided by a mentor who introduced me to the field and helped me get started with the basics. Over the years, I have completed several courses, projects, and even an internship in Machine Learning. My interests primarily lie in Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. Through this article, I aim to help you get started with AI/ML, much like my mentor did for me.
Additionally, I am one of the founding members of the Artificial Intelligence Society at IIT Delhi, which has been instrumental in fostering a community passionate about AI/ML.

## Introduction
Mathematics has many branches; these areas can be classified into pure and applied mathematics.
- Pure Mathematics is concerned with creating/defining interesting structures/objects and studying
and developing the theories for these objects. Some exciting areas of pure mathematics today are
Number Theory, Representation Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Topology, Differential Geometry,
Harmonic Analysis, Complex Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, etc.
- You will first encounter pure mathematics in MTL100 (Calculus) and MTL101 (Linear Algebra),
which might help you know whether you enjoy this kind of mathematics. From my experience,
pure mathematics takes time to grasp, but understanding it gives me a lot of happiness. There
is a sense of (almost) complete understanding/clarity of things that one studies in pure
mathematics, which might sometimes be lacking in other subjects.
- There is also Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, which could be
viewed as a part of pure mathematics owing to their abstract nature. You can check out
courses like MTL180 (Discrete Mathematics), MTL146 (Combinatorics), COL352 (Theory of
Computation), COL759 (Cryptography), and MTL768 (Graph Theory).
- For some who want to continue with pure mathematics, a PhD in mathematics is probably the
next thing to do. Most people would then like to continue with a job in Academia, which
involves research and teaching (in most cases).
-- Applied mathematics models real-life problems using these math structures and uses the theories
of pure mathematics to solve these problems. Some important areas of applied mathematics are
Probability and Stochastic Processes, Statistics, Numerical Analysis, Mathematical Biology,
Mathematical Economics and Game Theory, Optimization, Financial Mathematics, etc.
You can get a taste of applied mathematics through courses such as MTL103 (Optimization
Methods), MTL106 (Probability and Stochastic Processes), MTL107 (Numerical Methods),
MTL390 (Statistical Methods), etc.
-- A PhD in mathematics is probably a good next step for some who want to continue with
applied mathematics. However, you could also go for a job in the industry. Several MnC
graduates from the past few years are now involved in Quantitative Research, Quantitative
Trading, Data Science and Machine Learning.


## How a UG Student Can Explore and Pursue Research
Take electives right from your second year and undertake reading projects with professors whose
work interests you. Doing so will help you find out what you enjoy. It would be great if you could figure

out the area you want to continue with by the end of your second year. If you are a four-year (resp. five-
year) student, you must fill in the PhD applications during your 7th (resp. 9th) semester.

Therefore, after your second year, you will be left with a year (resp. two years) before these
applications. Make sure to do the following:

- Find three professors who can vouch for your talent and write about your work. These could be professors who taught you or you worked with on projects.
- Spend your third (resp. third and fourth) year reading/working on something advanced in your area of interest under the guidance of a faculty. You could also do a research internship somewhere outside IITD. The experience and knowledge you would gain from these projects would be crucial when you write your statement of purpose.
- In the third (resp. third and fourth) year(s), try to take up electives that reflect that you have solid foundations for continuing with a PhD in your proposed area.
- Finally, enjoy what you do! Being happy is the most important thing :)
