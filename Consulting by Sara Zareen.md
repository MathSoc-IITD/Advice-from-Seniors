## About the Author

I am Sara Zareen. I graduated this year from IITD with a B.Tech in Maths and Computing. I completed my summer internship at Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

## Introduction
Management Consulting is about working with your clients, usually businesses and companies, and helping them solve their problems using solid problem-solving skills. Consulting is a good option because it allows you to work in different sectors. 


## Tips to pursue Consulting
As a first-year student, I highly recommend you explore the field yourself first. You can register for case studies and contact the Business & Consulting Club (B&C) here at IIT Delhi. After discussing and deciding to pursue it, the biggest hurdle is the CV shortlisting process. Consulting companies look for well-rounded profiles, i.e., all metrics, such as CGPA, Scholastic Achievements, Extra Curricular Activities (ECAs), and Position of Responsibilities (PORs). It would help if you had some achievements in each sphere.
